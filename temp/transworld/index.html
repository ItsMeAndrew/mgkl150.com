    <h2> The video clip of the damages of the furnitures</h2>
    <p><iframe width="560" height="349" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/AgdP-q4J18U" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
    The video clip shows number of major damages we found on the day we received our shippments. We were very shocked and angry with how the packages were actually made, falsing your advertisement on your website. We can accept the damages if the wrappings were reasonably thick and secure, but almost all of the furnitures wrappings were single layered, exposing parts of the furniture causing crucial damages (breaks and cracks). This is not about the insurance cover as we understand that we didn't sign off the document to get the damages covered, but the wrappings were so bad from the beginning, it doesn't make any sense at all to expect the goods to be delivered safely without any damages. We expect your action upon the damages occurred.  <!--We are in process of finding every ways of getting our rights by discussing the issue with our lawyer. we also plan to publish every single details of the incident to let the publics know the lack of the packing skills. -->

    <h2>Dining Chairs(Qty: 6, Damaged: all (critical damages: 3), cost : $600 each = $3600)</h2>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/001.jpg" />
    <p>The picture above shows the damages occurred to the dining chairs. The one on the far right hand corner and the one on the bottom left have critical damages.</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/002.jpg" />
    <p>The piece came out from the package of the dining chair with the top part gone missing</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/003.jpg" />
    <p>The dining chair with the top part gone missing</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/004.jpg" />
    <p>another dining chair with the broken leg</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/005.jpg" />
    <p>And this is how you carelessly wrapped the dining chair. The leg part was not fully covered, and it was single wrapped. </p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/006.jpg" />
    <p>this is another evidence of careless-single wrappings for another dining chair, leaving huge gaps to allow dents and scratches</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/007.jpg" />
    <p>this is how the final wrappings were done for some of the dining chairs. they were not boxed, and the bottom part of the legs were fully exposed from the ripped packages. other dining chairs with box packages, were packed without any safe paddings (You padded the chairs with 3 pairs of shoes!!)</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/008.jpg" />
    <p>Of course you can't expect to secure the chairs with these packages because thery were only single bubble wrapped</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/009.jpg" />
    <p>Another picture of the packages with the legs came out of the package</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/010.jpg" />
    <p>This is different chair, with same method of packaging</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/011.jpg" />
    <p>And this is what happened to our chairs!</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/012.jpg" />
    <p>One piece of wrap for each leg. do you think this will fully secure the leg? you must be kidding!</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/013.jpg" />
    <p>another evidence of careless wrapping!</p>
    <img src="images/diningChairs/014.jpg" />
    <p>A huge dent on the top of the chair. This is on all of our 6 dining chairs, without missing any single ones</p>

    	<h2>Dining Table (costs: $2000)</h2>
        <img src="images/diningTable/001.jpg" />
        <p>The table was disassembled before the packing, so the four legs were packed separately. and we were also very surprised with their packages. The picture above shows one of the dining table legs packed. there was another leg packed in same way. and they both left lots of dents and scratches.</p>
        <img src="images/diningTable/002.jpg" />
        <p>Dents and scratches on the legs packed as the picture two above</p>
        <img src="images/diningTable/003.jpg" />
        <p>The other two legs were even worse. they were packed together with the single wrappings, no padding in between letting them bounce to each other.</p>
        <img src="images/diningTable/004.jpg" />
        <p>The package was very loose, leaving lots of rooms for the legs to play</p>
        <img src="images/diningTable/005.jpg" />
        <p>This is the picture we took while we unwrapping the legs, and see how they packed. No padding at all!</p>
        <img src="images/diningTable/006.jpg" />
        <p>and single bubble wrapped!</p>
